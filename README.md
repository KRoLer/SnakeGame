Your task is to model a Snake game, logic wise only.
There's a summary of what Snake is below.

No need for a fancy UI or threading, if you need to display something do it in Std.out!

Steps:
  1) Model the board (that wraps around), the snake and food pellets.
  2) Place a size 2 snake in the middle of the board and a food somewhere else than the snake.
  3) `Display` board state in the console (ASCII "art")
  4) Define a method that performs a 'step' of the game
    - takes a possible user input as parameter
    - is called from outside (Launcher?) at a regular time interval
    - update the board's state
  5) Code an input sequence that eats the first food pellet.
  6) Randomise food pellet placement


### Summary: Snake game

1. You control a Snake that moves around in a grid, the snake spans over a 2 cells at the beginning.
2. You can only turn the snake left or right and it moves one cell every "game turn".
3. There is always one food pellet on the grid.
4. Goal of the game is to eat said pellets by moving the snake to its position.
5. When the snake eats a pellet it grows one cell longer.
6. If the snake collides with itself, the game is lost.
7. If the snake reaches one of the grid's borders, it wraps around (i.e. going out on the left side means you come back in on the right side).
